# csid_bill_payer
Uses Selenium to automate a Chrome browser to pay your Coral Springs Improvement District water bill. Use at your own risk, if the CSID site changes this may not work as originally designed. Always confirm your payment succeeded independently.

To use

1) Fill in the config.js file with the values applicable to your water bill.
2) Run npm install
3) Run node app.js

Chrome should open, log you in, fill in your payment information, and submit to the confirmation page.
